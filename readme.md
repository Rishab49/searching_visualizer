# Searching Visualizer
A project created By me to show how searching algorithms work. It is created using HTML, CSS and Javascript and hosted on https://searching-visualizer-one.vercel.app/

Currently It has only 3 algorithms to visualize
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search
3. Ternary Search

you can also look at the working of the project in this video below
